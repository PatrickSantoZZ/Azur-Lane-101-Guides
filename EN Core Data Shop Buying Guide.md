## Core Data Picks
### Recommended Picks

Picks here are highly recommended to grab one as soon as you have enough core data.

![](/Resources/SR_Type_1_AP_Shell.png)<br>
__[Type 1 Armor Piercing Shell]()__<br>
__Price:__ 800 Core Data<br>
__Recommended Purchase Amount:__ at least 3 shells minimum, preferably 1 for every BB/BC/BM/BBV you use<br>
__Description:__ The white shell. One of the best auxiliary equipment to be used by BB/BC/BM/BBVs. Massive raw firepower (55  maxed out) stat increase with some nice accuracy (15 maxed out) stat increase, they're among one of the BB/BC/BM/BBVs best friend, along with the SHS. Additionally, it also increases the shelling critical damage (25% increase) which when it does crit, it hits very hard.

Highly recommended for most, if not all BB/BC/BM/BBVs. A must have core data shop pick as it's mandatory for the ship classes mentioned (some exceptions apply).

![](/Resources/SR_Super_Heavy_Shell.png)<br>
__[Super Heavy Shell]()__<br>
__Price:__ 800 Core Data<br>
__Recommended Purchase Amount:__ at least 3 minimum, preferably 1 for every BB/BC/BM/BBV you use<br>
__Description:__ The black shell. The cousin of the AP shell, while it doesn't have accuracy stat bonuses, it instead has a 70 firepower stat bonus (when maxed out) and an increase in shelling critical chance (8%). Basically the gun counterpart stat stick to the Oxytorp. BB/BC/BM/BBVs can benefit much for this increase in firepower.

Recommended for picks. Often paired with Type 1 Armor Piercing shell.

### Spare Core Data Picks
Picks here are mainly if you have spare core data. These are also good equipment for purchase but usually are in a slightly lower priority than the recommended picks. You can still pick some equipment here first if you really want to.

![](/Resources/UR_Type_93_Oxytorp.png)<br>
__[Type 93 Pure Oxygen Torpedo]()__<br>
__Price:__ 1500 Core Data<br>
__Recommended Purchase Amount:__ at least 3-5 torps (buy more if you want)<br>
__Description:__ This equipment, when maxed out, will give flat 100 torpedo stat which is huge buff for the torpedoes. Highly recommended for all DDs like Ayanami and Yuudachi for example. This auxiliary also benefits torpedo CLs and CAs as well to increase their damage output (especially CAs due to have a more effective gain).

The Oxytorp is a pretty expensive pick though and its stat boosts can't really compete with base damage upgrades or ballistic changes. Still though, if you have all the spare core data, do invest in some of these.

![](/Resources/SR_Fairey_Swordfish_818.png)<br>
__[Fairey Swordfish (818 Squadron)]()__<br>
__Price:__ 800 Core Data<br>
__Recommended Purchase Amount:__ at least 1-2 planes (buy more if you want)<br>
__Description:__ While weaker than most of the SR Torpedo Bombers in terms of damage and slightly slow launching, it makes up for its ability to inflict targets with slow movement (60% for 8 seconds), an effect most often found by Ark Royal and Centaur's skills. Good for constantly moving targets and fast movers. Often best used by ships with fewer torpedo bomber slots but nonetheless they can be used by any CV/CVL.

![](/Resources/SR_Twin_203mm_No_3_Prototype.png)<br>
__[Twin 203mm Prototype (No. 3)]()__<br>
__Price:__ 800 Core Data<br>
__Recommended Purchase Amount:__ at least 2-3 (buy more if you want)<br>
__Description:__ Commonly known as the Atago gun or A Taco gun, the 203mm Proto Type 3 is a straight upgraded 203mm Mounted gun with slightly better stats than its predecessor. Otherwise, its role is pretty much the same to the 203mm Mounted gun.

Now that PR has been released on EN server, this gun complements the Triple 203mm Prototype Mle 1934 since while it doesn't have a higher fire rate than the said gun, this gun instead boasts a more consistent DPS due to how the gun is fired (1 more shell too).

Recommended for players investing heavily on CAs.

### Niche to Useless Picks
Equipment mentioned here are not good picks due either being useless, or another equipment performing better than the ones listed here. Still, they are mentioned here as a caution to not pick these ones (unique equipment :butsuckystare:).

![](/Resources/E_Grumman_XF5F_Skyrocket.png)<br>
__[XF5F Skyrocket]()__<br>
__Price:__ 500 Core Data<br>
__Description:__ Fastest deploying fighters in the game. Doesn't help much since they can't drop bombs and AA wise, they are outclassed by easily available gold fighters.

![](/Resources/E_Type_94_Director.png)<br>
__[Type 94 AA Director]()__<br>
__Price:__ 300 Core Data<br>
__Description:__ Basically a weaker Air Radar with accuracy stat increase. Obsolete due to PR AA radar outperforming both of them.


### What about other items?
Once you can get the Recommended and Spare Picks above, you can freely skip the rest of the items as they're not really that worth the core data and it's recommended to do so. Unless you really want those boxes, then it's up to you.

## But wait, how do I get Core Data?
Core data drops from Story Hardmode for every clear (aka killing the boss). Core data can be also found in some daily and weekly quests and on events. The amount of Core Data you can obtain per clear depends on what world you do Hardmode on. Regardless of what map in the same world, you'll get the same amount of Cores (i.e. clearing 6-2 will give you the same amount of cores as doing 6-4).

The amount of Core Data per Hardmode world is as follows:
- Chapter 1 (1-x) = 4
- Chapter 2 (2-x) = 8
- Chapter 3 (3-x) = 10
- Chapter 4 (4-x) = 12
- Chapter 5 (5-x) = 14
- Chapter 6 (6-x) = 16
- Chapter 7 (7-x) = 18

One thing to note that core data shop stocks refreshes at the first day of every month and they may or may not add/remove new equipment/items. Also, you get to keep the core data forever as they're not tied to each map and will carry over to next month and so on.

At some occasions (usually announced by the devs), there will be a 3x Core Data Rate up usually lasting about a week. Any core data earned within those days have their amounts tripled (that's like 21 days of grinding core data in a week).

### Optimization of gathering Core Data?
It is possible to calculate the amount of core data you can gain per shop reset. There are 2 ways and can be found below:<br>
![](/Resources/Formulas/Core_Data_Formula.png)<br>
Second formula is used when there is 3x Core Data drops on some weeks.
