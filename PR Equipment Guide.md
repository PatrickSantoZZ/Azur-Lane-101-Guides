## PR Equipment Guide
This is an overview of all the new PR equipment that came with the Research update. Please note that this is not a tier list but a write up of what is this equipment, what is it used for, and is it recommended. If you want a tier list, you can go check Gurosebe's guide on equipment. This guide does not cover PR2 Equipment although it may be possibly included in the future.

All the names are from the Azur Lane Koumakan wiki and as such you can refer the stats there. Other wikis and in-game may have different naming.

### A note to PR Equipment
PR equipment can only be obtained by research the Tech Academy. Research is similar to what you will do in Commissions but it costs resources instead of using ships. Research does not award the equipment directly, rather it rewards blueprints of the equipment along with other rewards.

One thing to note is all Super Rare blueprints costs 10 blueprints more than the standard 15 blueprints, bumping it up to 25 blueprints. They are also slightly expensive to craft. Other than that, they pretty much function as other Super Rares, with the same upgrade costs in terms of gold and plates.
