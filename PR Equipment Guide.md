## PR Equipment Guide
This is an overview of all the new PR equipment that came with the Research update. Please note that this is not a tier list but a write up of what is this equipment about and what is it used for. If you want a tier list, you can go check Gurosebe's guide on equipment. This guide does not cover PR2 Equipment although it may be possibly included in the future.

All the names are from the Azur Lane Koumakan wiki and as such you can refer the stats there. Other wikis and in-game may have different naming.

### A note to PR Equipment
PR equipment can only be obtained by research the Tech Academy. Research is similar to what you will do in Commissions but it costs resources instead of using ships. Research does not award the equipment directly, rather it rewards blueprints of the equipment along with other rewards.

One thing to note is all Super Rare blueprints costs 10 blueprints more than the standard 15 blueprints, bumping it up to 25 blueprints. They are also slightly expensive to craft. Other than that, they pretty much function as other Super Rares, with the same upgrade costs in terms of gold and plates.

__[Improved Hydraulic Rudder](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Improved_Hydraulic_Rudder)__<br/>
__Equipment Type:__ Auxiliary<br/>
__Blueprints needed to craft:__ 25 Blueprints<br/>
__Description:__ One of the best auxiliary equipment in the game, the Improved Hydraulic Rudder increases the evasion stat by 40 when fully upgraded (the highest of all evasion equipment). Evasion stat basically increases the eHP of a ship thus enhancing their longevity in battles. Apart from that, it also has a 30% chance every 20 seconds to activate perfect dodge for 2 seconds which is basically projectile invulnerability for 2 seconds.

This equipment is best used on vanguard ships especially CAs (imagine [Beaver Badge](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Little_Beaver_Squadron_Tag) + this equipment on a CA). It doesn't benefit well with DDs but some destroyers may benefit from this equipment due to low evasion.

Highly Recommended for grabs.

__[High Performance Anti-Air Radar](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/High_Performance_Anti-Air_Radar)__<br/>
__Equipment Type:__ Auxiliary<br/>
__Blueprints needed to craft:__ 25 Blueprints<br/>
__Description:__ Basically an [Air Radar](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Air_Radar) on steroids. Compared to its purple cousin (70), this auxiliary equipment increases AA stat by 100 when maxed out. It also has a pseudo [SG Radar](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/SG_Radar)-like effect that reduces encounters with ambushes/airstrikes by 12%. It doesn't however evade ambushes/airstrikes unlike an [SG Radar](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/SG_Radar) does.

While it may not be useful now, once W12 and eventually W13 comes, this is a nice equipment for AA heavy ships and Repair ships due to the eventual plane flood on these worlds. This equipment also benefits [North Carolina](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/North_Carolina) well due to her skill buffing her firepower with AA stat.

Recommended for grabs. It pretty much replaces [Air Radar](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Air_Radar).

[![](/Resources/550mm%20Triple%20Torpedo%20Launcher.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/550mm_Triple_Torpedo_Launcher)</br>
__[550mm Triple Torpedo Launcher](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/550mm_Triple_Torpedo_Launcher)__<br/>
__Equipment Type:__ <br/>
__Blueprints needed to craft:__ 10 Blueprints<br/>
__Description:__ The fastest reloading triple torpedo launcher in the game. It also has a good alpha damage but suffers from only having 3 torpedoes launched, thus negating its advantage. Not to mention this equipment is much rarer to get compared to other research equipment.

It can be useful on Ibuki but there are better ones for her that, while slightly slower RoF than this torpedo launcher, has stronger alpha damage (533mm Quintuple Torpedo Launcher for example).

Very Niche. Good to have but not necessary.

__Equipment Type:__ <br/>
__Blueprints needed to craft:__ 5 Blueprints<br/>
__Description:__ The Twin variant of its Triple version. Has lower alpha potential due to being Rare rarity and two torpedoes. Not to mention the rarity of the equipment limits its usability to none.

Not Recommended.

__Description:__ An AA gun. Very lackluster compared to other AA guns out there and it's also a rare equipment in research.

Not recommended.

### Some Terms
eHP - Short for Effective Hitpoints. Basically the rough tankiness of a ship after factoring evasion and other damage reduction sources. Can be calculated by Maj. Procrastinator#8734's [Auto eHP Calculator](https://github.com/MajorProcrastinator/Auto-eHP-Calc)

Alpha - Short for Alpha Strike. Another term for burst damage in which it is an attack with high amounts of damage for a longer cooldown.

DPS - Short for Damage per Second. Refers to how much damage a ship and/or equipment is dealing over a second.

RoF - Short of Rate of Fire. Refers to how fast can an ship/equipment can fire.
